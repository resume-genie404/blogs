Many candidates think this is just a polite closing question…  
but in reality, it’s one of your **best opportunities** to show genuine interest, confidence, and professionalism.

The **worst** answer you can give?

❌ “No, I think everything is clear.”

This signals low curiosity, low preparation, and low enthusiasm.
