## Mastering the Art of a High-Impact CV

A standout CV is more than a record of employment — it’s a marketing document that positions you as the solution to an employer’s problem. When done well, it can realistically lead to several interviews in just a few weeks.

Below are 10 core features that consistently show up in CVs that get shortlisted.

### 1. Clean, Easy-to-Read Layout  

Recruiters scan CVs quickly, so visual clarity is non‑negotiable. Use:

- Clear section headings (e.g., *Profile, Experience, Skills, Education*)  
- Consistent font size and spacing  
- Bullet points instead of long paragraphs  

Avoid dense blocks of text, excessive colours, or complex graphics that distract from your message.

---

### 2. Tailored for the Role  

One generic CV for every job rarely works. For each application:

- Mirror the language of the job description where it’s accurate  
- Bring the most relevant experience to the top of each section  
- De‑emphasise or remove experience that doesn’t support your target role  

Your CV should make it obvious *within seconds* that you match the role.

### 3. Powerful Personal Summary  

Your personal summary is your professional “elevator pitch.” In 3–5 lines, it should answer:

- Who are you professionally?  
- What value do you bring?  
- What types of roles and industries are you targeting?  

**Example:**  
*Results‑driven Marketing Specialist with 5+ years’ experience in B2B SaaS, specialising in lead generation and email automation. Proven track record of increasing qualified leads and reducing acquisition costs. Seeking to leverage data‑driven campaign skills in a growth‑focused tech environment.*

---

### 4. Achievements Over Duties  

Listing responsibilities tells employers what you were *supposed* to do. Listing achievements shows what you *actually accomplished*.

Use **action verbs** (led, developed, improved, delivered) and quantify where possible:

- “Increased qualified leads by 35% in 6 months by redesigning email nurture journey.”  
- “Reduced onboarding time by 20% through creating standard operating procedures (SOPs).”  

Think in terms of **results, improvements, and impact**, not just tasks.

---

### 5. ATS‑Friendly Keywords  

Many organisations use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter CVs before a human ever sees them. To avoid being filtered out:

- Pull relevant keywords from the job advert (skills, tools, job titles, competencies)  
- Incorporate them naturally into your **summary, experience, and skills**  
- Avoid images or tables that hide important text from ATS parsers  

Your goal: ensure your CV is both **ATS‑readable** *and* human‑friendly.

### 6. Updated, Professional Contact Details  

Make it easy to reach you:

- Use a professional email address (e.g., *firstname.lastname@domain.com*)  
- Include a working phone number with country code  
- Add a link to a polished LinkedIn profile, portfolio, or GitHub (if relevant)  

Place these at the top of your CV so no one has to search for them.

---

### 7. Relevant Skills Section  

Create a skills section that supports your target role instead of listing everything you’ve ever done.

- Separate **technical skills** (tools, software, methodologies) and **core competencies** (leadership, communication, stakeholder management)  
- Prioritise skills explicitly requested in the job advert  
- Be honest — you should be comfortable being tested on anything you list  

This section acts as a quick “compatibility check” for recruiters.

---

### 8. Clear, Structured Work Experience  

List your roles in **reverse chronological order** (most recent first), and for each role include:

- Job title, company, location, and dates  
- A one‑line overview of the role  
- 3–6 bullet points highlighting achievements and responsibilities  

Focus more space on your most recent and relevant roles — those are the ones that carry the most weight.

---

### 9. Education & Certifications That Add Value  

Your education section should support your career story:

- List degrees, institutions, and graduation years (omit older dates if they create age bias concerns)  
- Add relevant modules or projects if you’re early in your career  
- Include certifications, licences, or short courses that reinforce your fit (e.g., PMP, CFA, AWS, Google Analytics, Scrum Master)  

Continuous learning signals ambition and adaptability.

---

### 10. Polished, Consistent, and Error‑Free  

Even a strong profile can be overlooked if your CV looks careless. To polish it:

- Run a spell‑check in your preferred language  
- Check dates, job titles, and formatting for consistency  
- Ask a trusted colleague or friend to review it for clarity and impact  

A CV with no typos, aligned formatting, and clear structure immediately feels more professional and reliable.

By applying these 10 principles, your CV becomes a targeted, persuasive document that clearly communicates why you deserve an interview — not just a list of where you’ve worked.
