A powerful resume isn't just about what you *add* — it’s equally about what you *remove*.  
Unnecessary information can clutter your CV, distract recruiters, and lower your chances of getting shortlisted.

Modern hiring teams skim resumes in seconds. A clean, relevant, and professional-looking CV gives you an immediate edge.

Here are the **8 things you should delete from your resume today** to make it sharper, cleaner, and more job-ready.

## 1️⃣ Delete Old School Information (High School or Primary School)

If you’re in university or already an experienced professional, there’s **no need to list your high school or primary school**.

**Cleaner Alternative:**  
Only include your **highest and relevant** education level (e.g., degree, diploma, certification).

This keeps your CV modern and focused.

## 2️⃣ Remove Long Hobby Descriptions

Recruiters don’t need to know about your love for hiking, baking, or your pet turtle… unless it’s relevant to the job.

**Keep it simple or remove entirely.**

Only include hobbies if they:  
- Showcase soft skills, or  
- Directly relate to the industry  

Otherwise → delete.

## 3️⃣ Get Rid of Unprofessional Email Addresses

“DramaQueen”, “CrazyGamer”, or “PartyAnimal4Life” won’t land you a job.

Use a **clean, professional** email format such as:  
👉 firstname.lastname@provider.com

Your email is part of your first impression. Make it count.

## 4️⃣ Delete Long Paragraphs — Use Bullets Instead

Recruiters spend seconds scanning a resume. Long blocks of text slow them down.

**Do this instead:**  
- Use bullet points  
- Keep each bullet to one strong sentence  
- Highlight achievements, not tasks  

A clean, skimmable layout instantly boosts readability.

## 5️⃣ Remove Irrelevant Work Experience

If a past job doesn’t add value to your current career goals — delete it.

Examples of roles to remove:  
- Unrelated part-time student jobs  
- Temporary gigs with no transferable skills  
- Outdated roles from over 10 years ago (unless critical)

Focus on **experience that aligns** with the roles you’re applying for.

## 6️⃣ Delete Irrelevant Skills

Recruiters don’t want to see:  
- “Cooking”  
- “Driving”  
- “Drawing”  
- “Social media (personal use)”  

Unless these skills directly support your career — remove them.

Instead, highlight:  
### ✔ Hard Skills  
- CRM tools  
- Data analytics  
- Technical tools  
- Software proficiency  

### ✔ Soft Skills  
- Communication  
- Leadership  
- Problem-solving

## 7️⃣ Remove Personal Information (Marital Status, Religion, DOB)

This information is **private** and irrelevant to hiring.

Delete the following from your CV:  
- Marital status  
- Religion  
- Date of birth  
- Gender  
- Number of children  

Modern recruiters avoid these due to anti-discrimination regulations.

## 8️⃣ Never Include Your ID Number

Your CV is often shared across multiple systems, platforms, and HR tools.

Including sensitive data like your **national ID number** puts you at risk.  
It’s unnecessary and unsafe.

Keep your personal identity protected — don't include it.
