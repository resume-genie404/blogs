Your resume is more than a list of job titles — it’s your professional story, your branding document, and the first impression that determines whether you move forward or get overlooked.

In a world where recruiters skim resumes in seconds and ATS filters screen thousands of applications, getting it right matters more than ever.

Below are the **top 5 things to keep in mind** while drafting a resume that truly stands out.

## 1️⃣ Lead With Impact, Not Tasks

Most candidates simply list what they *did*. Exceptional candidates highlight what they *achieved*.

**Instead of this:**  
- “Handled customer queries”

**Try this:**  
- “Resolved 95% of customer issues on first contact, improving satisfaction by 18%”

**Why it matters:**  
Impact-driven writing shows value, results, and competence — the three things hiring managers care about most.

## 2️⃣ Tailor Your Resume for Every Role

One-size-fits-all resumes get lost in the pile.

Every job description has hidden clues:  
- Required skills  
- Industry keywords  
- Preferred experience  
- Role-specific responsibilities  

**Align your resume** with these signals to boost both ATS scores and human appeal.

A tailored resume says:  
✔ “I understand your needs.”  
✔ “I’m the right match.”

## 3️⃣ Use Keywords Strategically (ATS Matters!)

Applicant Tracking Systems scan resumes before recruiters ever see them.

To get through:  
- Use industry and role-specific keywords  
- Include tools, technologies, and key competencies  
- Mirror language from the job description naturally  

**Example:**  
If the job mentions “project coordination,” “cross-functional collaboration,” or “CRM management,” your resume should reflect these — *when genuinely relevant*.

## 4️⃣ Make It Skimmable and Clean

Recruiters spend **6–8 seconds** on a first pass.  
Your layout should guide their eyes effortlessly.

Best practices:  
- Clear section headers  
- Consistent formatting  
- Bullet points over paragraphs  
- Modern, simple fonts  
- White space to improve readability  

A visually clean resume = a mentally easy resume.
