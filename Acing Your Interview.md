An interview is not just a test of knowledge — it’s a **conversation of trust**. Companies evaluate:

- **How you think**  
- **How you communicate**  
- **How you handle pressure**  
- **How well you fit the culture and team**

Understanding this shifts your mindset from “being tested” to “building a connection.”

## 📝 Step 1: Research Like a Pro

Before the interview, make sure you understand:

- The company’s mission, values, and culture  
- Their top products and services  
- Their recent achievements or challenges  
- The role’s requirements and expectations  
- The hiring manager or team if available

This preparation shows respect, initiative, and genuine interest.

## 📣 Step 2: Craft Your Personal Story

Every interviewer will ask some version of:

- “Tell me about yourself.”  
- “Walk me through your resume.”  
- “Why should we hire you?”

Your story should be:

- **Concise**  
- **Chronological**  
- **Achievement-driven**  
- **Aligned with the job role**

Focus on how your experience positions you as the **ideal fit**.

Examples include:
- “Tell me about a time you solved a difficult problem.”  
- “Describe a situation where you showed leadership.”  
- “How do you handle conflict at work?”

Use **STAR**:
- **S**ituation  
- **T**ask  
- **A**ction

### **Technical Questions**
Show your expertise, tools, and problem-solving approach.

- Maintain eye contact  
- Sit upright with open posture  
- Smile frequently  
- Use natural hand gestures
