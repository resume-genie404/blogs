## Build a CV That Gets Noticed — And Gets Results

The hiring landscape has changed. Recruiters now skim hundreds of applications, Applicant Tracking Systems pre‑filter candidates, and hiring managers expect evidence of impact — not just responsibilities.

A modern CV must be **strategic, concise, and data‑driven**. Here’s how to align yours with current expectations.

---

### 1. A Visually Balanced, Reader-Friendly Structure  

Modern CVs prioritise clarity over decoration. That means:

- A simple, professional font (no novelty typefaces)  
- Logical sections with clear headings  
- Adequate white space to avoid visual fatigue  

If a recruiter can’t quickly find your profile, experience, and skills, they’re likely to move on.

---

### 2. Customisation for Each Application  

Employers can instantly spot a generic CV. A modern approach:

- Adjust your **headline and summary** for each role  
- Reorder bullet points so the most relevant achievements appear first  
- Emphasise projects, tools, and industries that match the job  

You don’t need to rewrite everything — but you *do* need to refine it for each application.

---

### 3. A Strong, Intentional Opening Summary  

Instead of an outdated “Objective,” use a **Professional Summary** that:

- Positions you within your niche (“Senior Data Analyst in retail and e‑commerce”)  
- Highlights 3–4 core strengths or signature achievements  
- Signals what you’re aiming for next (e.g., “seeking leadership role in…”)  

Think of it as the paragraph that convinces a time‑poor reader to keep going.

---

### 4. Impact-Oriented Achievements  

Today’s employers value outcomes, not activity. Strengthen each bullet point by including:

- **Action** — what you did  
- **Context** — why it mattered  
- **Result** — what changed because of your work  

**Weak:** “Responsible for managing social media accounts.”  
**Stronger:** “Managed 5 social media channels and increased engagement by 40% in 9 months through A/B-tested content and audience segmentation.”

---

### 5. Strategic Keyword Integration for ATS  

Most mid‑to large‑sized organisations rely on Applicant Tracking Systems to filter CVs. To work with them, not against them:

- Use standard section titles (e.g., *Experience*, *Skills*)  
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job advert into your **experience** and **skills**  
- Avoid embedding key information in images or complex graphics  

Your CV should pass both the **algorithm test** and the **human test**.

---

### 6. Professional and Complete Contact Information  

Modern CVs usually include:

- Full name (no nicknames)  
- City and country (full address optional)  
- Phone number with international dial code (if applying globally)  
- Professional email  
- Links to LinkedIn and relevant portfolios  

Optional for some professions: personal website, GitHub, Behance, or Substack.

---

### 7. Skills Presented as Job-Relevant Clusters  

Instead of a long mixed list, group skills into clear categories, such as:

- **Technical Skills:** Python, SQL, Tableau, Salesforce, Figma  
- **Methodologies:** Agile, Scrum, Design Thinking, OKRs  
- **Core Competencies:** Stakeholder management, problem solving, team leadership  

This style helps hiring managers quickly confirm your fit for the position.

---

### 8. Experience That Tells a Coherent Story  

Your experience section should read like a narrative of **increasing responsibility and impact**.

For each role, show:

- How big your scope was (team size, budget, markets, users, revenue band)  
- What problems you solved  
- How your work supported business goals  

If you’ve changed industries or careers, draw attention to **transferable skills** that connect the dots.

---

### 9. Education, Certifications, and Ongoing Learning  

Employers increasingly value continuous development. Strengthen this section by including:

- Degrees and relevant academic achievements  
- Professional certifications (e.g., PMP, ACCA, AWS, CIPD)  
- Short courses, nano‑degrees, or workshops that support your current path  

Place the education section above experience only if you’re a recent graduate or making a major early‑career pivot.

---

### 10. Final Polish: Consistency, Brevity, and Tone  

A modern CV is typically:

- 1–2 pages for most professionals  
- Written in clear, concise language (no jargon for its own sake)  
- Consistent in tense, formatting, bullet style, and punctuation  

Before sending, read it out loud once. Anything that sounds vague, repetitive, or generic should be rewritten to be sharper and more concrete.

---

A well‑designed, targeted CV will not guarantee every job — but it will consistently **win you more serious conversations**. Paired with thoughtful applications and a strong LinkedIn presence, it becomes a powerful tool in your job search strategy.
