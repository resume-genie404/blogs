## Build a CV That Gets Noticed — And Gets Results

In competitive job markets, a CV must be more than polished — it must be strategic, data-driven, and aligned with employer expectations. Below is a deeper, research-backed breakdown of what hiring managers look for today.

### 1. A Visually Balanced, Reader-Friendly Structure  
Recruiters spend an average of 6–8 seconds on the first scan. Modern CVs employ layout hierarchy, spacing, and typography that guide the eye with purpose.

### 2. Customization for Each Application  
Research shows tailored CVs are 3× more likely to result in interviews. Adapting your content to the job description is a critical differentiator.

### 3. A Strong Opening Summary  
A concise personal summary acts as your elevator pitch — communicating your strengths, specialization, and industry relevance at a glance.

### 4. Impact-Oriented Achievements  
Employers prioritize measurable results: revenue growth, efficiency gains, cost reductions, or performance improvements.

### 5. Strategic Keyword Integration  
ATS systems filter out up to 75% of applicants. Using job-relevant keywords ensures your CV reaches human eyes.

### 6. Accurate, Professional Contact Information  
Include an appropriate email address, updated phone number, and a complete LinkedIn profile. Optional additions: portfolio links or GitHub.

### 7. Well-Defined Skills Cluster  
Highlighting critical competencies — both hard and soft — helps employers immediately identify your match for the role.

### 8. Comprehensive Experience Section  
Focus on clarity, quantifiable achievements, and relevance to the target role. Avoid outdated or irrelevant positions.

### 9. Verified Education & Credentials  
List formal education, certifications, and ongoing learning that demonstrate commitment to professional development.

### 10. Error-Free, Final Polish  
Professional proofreading significantly increases perceived credibility. Employers associate clean documents with reliable candidates.
